      <p>EVENT 1: The Egyptians made taxes</p>
        <p>

        The first income tax was made in ancient Egypt. Most Egyptians owed labor and a portion of their yield of crops to the pharaoh. When villages failed to reach their tax quota, the pharaoh would punish the administrator of the village quite severely. At around 1640 BC, the pharaoh started to tax individual people individually instead of the administrator.

    <p>EVENT 2: Odd but true!!!</p>
    <p>
        
        
        Peter The Great had a tax on beards. He saw it as a way to get Russia more in line with the western cultures. If anyone refused to pay the tax and was caught on the street with a beard they would be forcibly restrained and their beards cut off. Henry the 8th also saw fit to enforce this policy on his country men. He saw it as a convient way to make more money from taxes. But the king himself was exempt from paying the beard tax. These policies respectivly were made in 1698 for Peter and 1535 for Henry.

    <p>EVENT 3: Odd but true!!! (the seccond time)</p>
    <p>
        
        
        The British hat tax was made in the thinking that the British government could tax more money from the weathier folk (who probably had many expensive and lavish hats) compared to the peasants (who probably only had one or two hats at most). This tax was based on how many hats you had and the cost of said hats. Say you had one hat that was really well made and was fairly expensive (8-9 shillings), the government would tax you about 8-9 pence for the hat. A shilling is worth about a dollar and a pence is closer to a penny. This took place from 1784 to 1811.

    <p>EVENT 4 and 5: First income taxes in the USA!!!!</p>
    <p>
        
        
        
        In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed income tax into being. He made this tax to help the government pay for the expenses of the Civil War. Back in the old days income tax had a 3 percent tax on incomes between $600 and $10,000 and a 5 percent tax on incomes of more than $10,000. $10,000 in 1862 is now worth $297,000 in todays money. But in 1867, people damanded that the tax rates be lowered, so Congress lowered taxes and instead of making most of the tax money from income, tax they made more from recreational products like beer, wine, and tobacco. People still weren't happy with income tax and demanded it was thrown away all togather, so income tax was revoked in 1872. But soon after, in 1894, it was reinstated with the Wilson Terrif Act and the IRS (the group of people that everybody hates) was made.

    <p>EVENT 6: Taxes pay for war</p>
    <p>
        
        
        During the World War 1 era as part of the Revenue Act of 1918, income tax rates were raised to up to 77 percent (personaly I would not want to live in that era). The 77 percent income tax only applied to people (or companies) who made over 1,000,000 dollars in revenue. In 1918 only 5 percent of the population paid income tax. But it funded a third of the cost of World War 1.

    <p>EVENT 7: Big, bad guy doesnt pay taxes, instantly regrets it</p>
    <p>
        
        
        Al Capone was a pretty terrible person in all regards. He killed people but was ultimatly arrested at age 33 on tax evasion charges. On October 18, 1931, Capone was arrested for tax evasion. He reportedly owed the government $217,000 in back taxes. He was sentenced to 11 years in federal prison. First Cook county jail then later after his trial he was sent to Alcatraz Island.

    <p>EVENT 8: IRS agent says he doesn't know about taxes</p>
    <p>
        

        Joseph Nunen was the commisioner of the IRS. He was arrested for tax evasion in 1952, because of a bet he made with a friend. The $1800 bet was about a presidential canditate winning. He won the bet and did not file the taxes properly resulting in a convition for tax evasion. But that wasnt the only thing that investigators found. He had been funneling money over the years do his bank account and actualy owed around $90,000 in back taxes. In all of his trials he claimed not to be a tax expert desipite being a leader of the tax agency.

    <p> EVENT 9: WILLIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>
       
        
        Willie Nelson wrote an album to pay for taxes owed to the IRS.  It was called The IRS Tapes, featured just him and his guitar, and was his 39th albumn, released in 1990.  The album made 3.6 million dollars and Willie used the money to pay the IRS, along with nine million dollars more.  The IRS claimed that Willie owed 16 million.  This was because his accountants, Price Waterhouse, had not been paying his taxes for years.

    <p>EVENT 10: Astronauts pay taxes in space</p>
    <p>
        
        
        US taxes are based on citizenship and because of this, astronauts have to pay them even when they are "off planet." Because they are living in space, astronauts qualify for an automatic extension of their tax returns for two months.  And, if they need it, they can request an additional four months to extend until October.  Jack Swigart was an astronout on Apollo 13 and he had to call mission control while in space to get help filing his taxes. I personally would say that astronouts should still have to pay taxes on the basis that NASA is a government subsidiary.</label>
